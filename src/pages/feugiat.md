We support each other by observing the following principles:

* We affirm the intrinsic beauty in ourselves, each other, and
  those in and around our community even when we disagree
  with each other.
* Our struggles are similar, but also individual in nature. Our
  individual struggles need not be quantified or compared to
  those experienced by others, only shared.
* We are most helpful to others when we share of ourselves
  and our own journey including its triumphs and difficulties
  as it relates to gender; thus, we avoid sharing of rumors,
  innuendo, or the experiences of others.
* Medical practice is an important part to our journeys;
  information shared here based upon individual experience
  doesn’t replace advice from a qualified professional.
* We hold information shared here in confidence,
  remembering that living our own truths must be done in
  each person’s time including the decision to live openly.
* When we share, we identify ourselves including our name
  as we'd like to be addressed, our preferred pronouns and
  our status (in/out).
* When others are sharing, we make every attempt to listen
  without judgement; when we ask each other clarifying
  questions, we ask questions rooted in inquiry with an
  interest in expanding our own understanding of each
  other’s experience.
* Though we ourselves are politicized, these meetings are
  non-partisan and thus we limit our discussion of politics
  except in the cases where our own ability to live safely
  and openly is being directly impacted by the politically
  motivated violence.
* Allies in direct support of a transgender members are
  welcome except in cases where meetings are closed.
